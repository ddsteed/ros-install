	> Marker.h NOT found
	
	Some package is compiled based on others, however, parallelized compilations do NOT have fixed order so it may occur library file not found.
	
	- run compilation again :-)

	> mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture (have 'arm64', need 'x86_64')
	
	M1 chip compiles code as arm64 architecture. One has to add 'arch -x86_64' before 'make' or 'CC/CXX'.

	> no viable conversion from normal pointer to smart shared_ptr
  
   log4cxx 0.12.0 upgrade pointer to smart one, so one has to install 0.10.0 version and link it manually. (do NOT use brew version.)
   - brew uninstall default log4cxx since catkin\_make's find_package will search system firstly
   - install log4cxx 0.10.0 from source

	SIP v5 will not include an extensible build system, i.e it will not provide an equivalent of SIP v4â€™s sipconfig module. Consequently a version of PyQt built with SIP v5 will not provide an equivalent of the pyqtconfig module.
	
	However, this error does NOT occur in MAC.
